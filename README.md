# Compile

I recommend that you use Cygwin and mingw-w64 to compile.

In the Cygwin installer, install the following packages:
- `git`
- `mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core`

In the Cygwin terminal, simply run `./build.bat` to compile.

## 32-bit

To compile a 32-bit version, get the cygwin package `mingw64-i686-gcc-core` and edit `build.bat`.
